Motor: (modified pins)
PD6: Right motor forward, PWM timer0
PD3: Right motor reverse, PWM timer2
PD5: Left motor forward, PWM timer0
PB1: Left motor reverse, PWM timer1

PD4: Trig pin
PB0: Echo pin

SPI:
PB4: MISO
PB3: MOSI
PB5: SCK
PB2: CS

Motor pins were changed because PB2 is reserved for CS in SPI
